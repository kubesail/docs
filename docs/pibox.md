# PiBox by KubeSail

Designed with simplicity in mind, KubeSail now ships a custom low-cost cluster, pre-installed with Kubernetes and the KubeSail agent. The design is based on the [Raspberry Pi 4 Compute Module](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/cm4/cm4-product-brief.pdf), includes 2 expandable SATA SSD ports, and starts at $150. PiBox is ideal for home and small office use, and makes it simple to take advantage of 1-click installable KubeSail templates and backups.
