# PiBox by KubeSail

PiBox is a hardware device being developed by KubeSail. The PiBox is designed for hackers, tinkerers, and self-hosters, and does not require the use of KubeSail software to operate.

More information will be available here when we are closer to shipping, such as how to flash your device and enable the required SATA kernel modules.
