# Deployment options

Learn how to deploy [Node.js](#nodejs), [Python](#python), and [Ruby on Rails](#ruby-on-rails) apps onto Kubernetes.

- Create a Dockerfile
- Build and push your Docker image
- Deploy your app on any Kubernetes cluster

## Node.js

KubeSail created **[`deploy-node-app`](https://kubesail.com/blog/deploy-node-app)** as a migration tool to deploy your existing Node.js application onto any Kubernetes cluster. By running **`npx deploy-node-app`** inside your app's directory, this utility will generate a Dockerfile, build and push deployment images, generate Kubernetes configurations files, and trigger a deployment on your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
npx deploy-node-app
```

This tool generates all the boilerplate required for container-based deployments on **Kubernetes** or **Docker**.

- Create a Dockerfile if none exists
- Create a Kubernetes Deployment or **`docker-compose.yaml`** file
- Automatically map ports from Docker to your Node app
- Build and push your Docker image
- Deploy your app on any Kubernetes cluster

If you don't have an existing Node app, KubeSail created **[`create-node-app`](https://github.com/create-node/create-node-app)** as an easy way to bootstrap a new app with React, Express, Postgres, and Redis.

```bash
npx create-node-app my-node-app
```

## Python

### Create a Dockerfile for Python

- Create an image containing your Python application by placing a file called **`Dockerfile`** in the root of your project.
- Update the line with **`your-daemon-or-script.py`**.

```bash
FROM python:3

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD [ "python", "./your-daemon-or-script.py" ]
```

Then, continue on to build and push your Docker image.

## Ruby on Rails

### Create a Dockerfile for Rails

- Create an image containing your Ruby on Rails application by placing a file called **`Dockerfile`** in the root of your project.

```bash
FROM ruby:2.5
RUN apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -y nodejs postgresql-client
RUN mkdir /myapp
WORKDIR /myapp
COPY Gemfile /myapp/Gemfile
COPY Gemfile.lock /myapp/Gemfile.lock
RUN bundle install
COPY . /myapp

EXPOSE 3000

# Start the main process.
CMD ["rails", "server", "-b", "0.0.0.0"]
```

Then, continue on to build and push your Docker image.

## Build your Docker image

Run the following command with **`username`** being your Docker Hub username.

```bash
docker build . -t username/your-image-name
docker push username/your-image-name
```

## Deploy your app to KubeSail

Once you've built your image and pushed to Docker Hub, you can deploy your app to KubeSail. Update the **`image`** section of the config below, and then **apply** your updates using kubectl.

```yml
#?filename=sample-app.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: your-app
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: your-app
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: your-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: your-app
          image: username/your-image-name
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports:
            - name: listen-port
              containerPort: 8080
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 10m
              memory: 128Mi
            limits:
              cpu: 1
              memory: 256Mi
```
