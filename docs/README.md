### Isn't a Self-Hosting Service kind of a contradiction in terms?

If self-hosting is all about breaking free from subscription services, owning your own data, and taking back ownership on the internet, why the heck would anyone sign up for a subscription to self-host!?

This is a fantastic question, and one that answers itself as your self-hosting journey unfolds:


- Fighting Google Photos with Photostructure feels great - but what if your [hard drive dies](/backups)?

- Each self-hosted app has different install instructions. We [standardize and secure it](/templates).

- Okay, your apps are installed - now how do you get [valid and secure encryption](/tunneling#certificates)?

- Hosting apps on the internet isn't too hard - but what if your ISP blocks [web-serving](/tunneling)?

- Clicking install on other peoples apps is fun and all, but [how do I deploy my own code](/builder)?

Our service aims to provide everything home-hosting is missing.
